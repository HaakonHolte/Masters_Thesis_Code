Code for my master's thesis "Survival Analysis with Deep Recurrent Neural Network Model for Prediction of Credit Card Defaults"

This repository consists of the code used to obtain the results and perform data analysis in my master's thesis, titled "Survival Analysis with Deep Recurrent Neural Network Model for Prediction of Credit Card Defaults". The thesis will be published by NTNU at some point in the near future, and I will include a link to it here when it is published (provided I don't forget about it). Note that the code was written to fit a specific dataset, which due to privacy and confidentiality is not available to the public. This means that reproducing the results will not be possible, however this repository mainly exists for those who evaluate the thesis to see the amount of work that has been done, and to inspect the functionality of the code. The code was written using PyCharm and scientific mode, which allows for splitting the program into cells which can be run independently of eachother. The sign combination #%% is used to separate the different cells.
